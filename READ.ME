# KPI Reminder Script

This project contains a Google Apps Script that automatically sends KPI reminder emails to employees based on data stored in a Google Sheet.

## 📌 What It Does

- Reads employee data from the first sheet of a Google Spreadsheet
- Sends a daily KPI reminder email to each employee
- Includes:
  - Employee name
  - KPI task link
  - Due date
- Skips rows without an email address

## 📄 Spreadsheet Structure

The script expects the following columns in **Row 1 (header row)**:

| Column | Description |
|------|-------------|
| A | Employee Name |
| B | Employee Email |
| C | KPI Task Link |
| D | Due Date |
| E | Manager Email (currently not used) |

Data should start from **Row 2**.

## 🧠 Script Logic

- Uses `SpreadsheetApp` to read data
- Uses `MailApp.sendEmail()` to send reminders
- Always reads from the **first sheet** in the spreadsheet

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open Google Sheets
2. Go to **Extensions → Apps Script**
3. Paste the code into `Code.gs`
4. Save the project
5. Run `sendKpiReminders()` once to authorize
6. (Optional) Set a **time-driven trigger** to run daily

## ⏰ Optional: Daily Trigger

- In Apps Script:
  - Go to **Triggers**
  - Add a **Time-driven trigger**
  - Run once per day (e.g., every morning)

## 🔐 Permissions

The script requires permission to:
- Read Google Sheets
- Send emails on your behalf
